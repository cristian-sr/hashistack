# Hashistack - Packer build on EL7/8
Complete Hashistack including Enterprise versions of Terraform, Consul, Vault, Nomad, all in a single packer manifest.  Builds in parallel on Qemu, VirtualBox, GCP, AWS, and Azure using CentOS 7 base image.  Replicated still doesn't support RHEL 8 (Docker) so I will default this to RHEL 7 if/until it does.  Vault is used for build credentials where possible.

This is built in parallel on CentOS 7 using Packer and acquiring cloud credentials from Vault which you need to configure.  Hashicorp ENT RPMs are installed with YUM and will automatically update daily once deployed.  Terraform Enterprise is installed (partially) to the point where you can just add your Replicated license to deploy TFE.  Terraform Enterprise will update automatically or manually based on the license file you give it.
